Pascal Sample Code

I was a partner in a CAD engineering company from 1995-2004.

This is Pascal code I wrote for a AutoCad type program then called MiniCAD.

Once the Engineer has laid out all of the device placement on the drawing, these routines will calculate the wiring necessary between them, calculating the necessary wire size for the runs, the conduit sizes required by code, and all of the voltage drops across each node.

The voltage drops are further temperature compensated, in as much as this equipment does not run under a load heavy enough to raise the temperature of the wire thru its loading.

These routines further create spreadsheet like tables within the drawing itself, linked to the devices, showing all of the calculations visibly.

The original routines were done in the mid 90's, these versions were done in 1999.
